## Concept

BB is a comprehensive app for home gardeners, efficiently providing relevant growing info on 230+ plants, as well as the pests you may encounter and how to deal with them. App uses client location and multiple web APIâ€™s to offer localized USDA zone filtering.  Users can add, edit, and save plants.

Future functionality will incorporate 2d bin packing to let users create visual renderings of rectangular garden plots with dynamic plant icons, laid out according to the spacing requirements of the chosen plants.  I am currently building this component!

## Features

- Client built with React/Tailwind
- Back end built with Django
